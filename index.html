        <p id = "aboutme">
                My name is Sabrina and I graduated last year from University of Michigan with a BSE in Industrial Engineering. I currently work for the Commodities and Energy Team at Morningstar Inc, in downtown Chicago. I was born and raised in Guatemala City, Guatemala and moved to the United States to complete my undergraduate studies. The exposure that Iâ€™ve had to the Fin Tech industry, has encouraged me to want to pursue a future career in software engineering. I want to have the opportunity to join the Quantitative Research Team at Morningstar as a Quant Developer.

                When I am not working or coding, I love exercising and spending time with my friends. I enjoy walking to North Avenue Beach in the afternoons or going to rooftops in the city to watch the sunset. I also love travelling and learning about different cultures abroad. My favorite destination besides Guatemala, has been Santorini, Greece. I also enjoy spending time with my dog and with my younger brother, Carlos.
